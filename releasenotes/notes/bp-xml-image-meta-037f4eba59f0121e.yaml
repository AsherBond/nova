features:
  - |
    Additional information regarding an instance's flavor (the ID
    and the defined extra specs at the time the instance was launched)
    has been added to the libvirt domain metadata for instances.
    This allows downstream clients that queries libvirt domain metadata,
    such as Ceilometer, to avoid performing additional Nova API queries
    to get this information.

upgrades:
  - |
    To expose the newly added attributes in the libvirt domain metadata
    in an upgraded environment, already running instances will need to
    be shutdown, restarted, cold migrated or shelved and unshelved.
