    Ironic nova-compute services can now target a specific shard of ironic
    nodes by setting the config ``[ironic]shard``.
    This is particularly useful when using active-passive methods to choose
    on which physical host your ironic nova-compute process is running,
    while ensuring ``[DEFAULT]host`` stays the same for each shard.
    You can use this alongside ``[ironic]conductor_group`` to further limit
    which ironic nodes are managed by each nova-compute service.
    Note that when you use ``[ironic]shard`` the ``[ironic]peer_list``
    is hard coded to a single nova-compute service.
