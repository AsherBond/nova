    The nova-api and nova-metadata services now can be run in native threading
    mode instead of with eventlet. This is an experimental feature that is
    disabled by default. Please read the
    `concurrency <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/concurrency.html>`__
    guide for more details.
