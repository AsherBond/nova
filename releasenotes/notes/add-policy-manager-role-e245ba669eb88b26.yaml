    The Nova policies introduce ``manager`` default roles provided by
    keystone. A ``project_manager`` denoted by someone with the ``manager``
    role on a project. It is intended to perform more privileged operations
    than ``project_member`` on its project resources. To avoid any change in
    ``admin`` permissions, Nova use ``PROJECT_MANAGER_OR_ADMIN`` as default.

    Currently, nova supports:

    * ``admin``
    * ``project_manager``
    * ``project_member``
    * ``project_reader``

    Currently, scope checks and new defaults are enabled by default. It is
    recommended to use new defaults but if your deployment need more time
    then you can disable them by switching the below config option in
    ``nova.conf`` file.:

      [oslo_policy]
      enforce_new_defaults=False
      enforce_scope=False

    Please refer `Policy New Defaults`_ for detail about policy new defaults.

    In this release, the below APIs policy are default to
    ``PROJECT_MANAGER_OR_ADMIN``:

    - ``os_compute_api:os-migrate-server:migrate`` ("Cold migrate a server
      without specifying a host")
    - ``os_compute_api:os-migrate-server:migrate_live`` (live migrate server
      without specifying host)
    - ``os_compute_api:os-migrations:index`` (List migrations without host
      info)
    - ``os_compute_api:servers:migrations:index`` (Lists in-progress live
      migrations for a given server without host info)
    - ``os_compute_api:servers:migrations:force_complete`` (Force an
      in-progress live migration for a given server)
    - ``os_compute_api:servers:migrations:delete`` (Delete(Abort) an
      in-progress live migration)

    To introduced ``project_manager`` in migration APIs, we need to add a few
    new policies.

    * Live migrate:

      - Existing policy is used when live migrate server without specifying
        host:

        - ``os_compute_api:os-migrate-server:migrate_live`` (live migrate
          server without specifying host)
        - Default: ``PROJECT_MANAGER_OR_ADMIN``
      - New policy is used when live migrate server to a specific host:

        - ``os_compute_api:os-migrate-server:migrate_live:host`` (live migrate
          server to a specific host)
        - Default: ``ADMIN``

    * List server migration:

      - Existing policy is used to list live migrations without host info:

        - ``os_compute_api:servers:migrations:index`` (Lists in-progress live
           migrations for a given server)
        - Default: ``PROJECT_MANAGER_OR_ADMIN``
      - New policy is used to host info in live migrations list:

        - ``os_compute_api:servers:migrations:index:host`` (Lists in-progress
          live migrations for a given server with host info)
        - Default: ``ADMIN``

    * List migration:

      - Existing policy is used to list live migrations without host info:

        - ``os_compute_api:os-migrations:index`` (List migrations without
          host info)
        - Default: ``PROJECT_MANAGER_OR_ADMIN``
      - New policy is used to host info in live migrations list:

        - ``os_compute_api:os-migrations:index:all_projects`` (List migrations
          for all or cross projects)
        - Default: ``ADMIN``
        - ``os_compute_api:os-migrations:index:host`` (List migrations
          with host info)
        - Default: ``ADMIN``
upgrade:
  - |
    New policies are added to the live migration APIs with the same default.
    If you are using default policy, then no action is needed, but if you have
    overridden the existing live migration policies in your deployment, you
    must include the new policy with the same permissions.

    - Existing policy:

      - ``os_compute_api:os-migrate-server:migrate_live``
      - ``os_compute_api:servers:migrations::index``
      - ``os_compute_api:os-migrations:index``
    - New policy:

      - ``os_compute_api:os-migrate-server:migrate_live:host``
      - ``os_compute_api:servers:migrations:index:host``
      - ``os_compute_api:os-migrations:index:all_projects``
      - ``os_compute_api:os-migrations:index:host``
